## <samp> What</samp>

<samp>This repository contains RetroArch overlays I made for my Nothing Phone 2.</samp>

## <samp> Available Overlays</samp>

<samp>- `nds/`: NDS overlay (configuration file and image).</samp>

## <samp> Installation</samp>

1. <samp>Download this repository as a ZIP from GitHub and extract it to your device.</samp>
2. <samp>In RetroArch, set the overlay path to the overlay configuration file. Point the overlay path to the config file (for example: `nds/np2-nds-v2.cfg`).</samp>
3. <samp>Make sure the configuration file and its image are in the same folder — RetroArch requires the config and image to be colocated.</samp>
